# scripts/convert_burden.py
"""Convert the Audain 2026 case-control supplement into `mirrors/burden.tsv`.

Run locally by a curator, never by CI or the build -- design decision D6. The
output is committed, so a refresh is a reviewable diff rather than a silent
change under a build.

    .venv/bin/python scripts/convert_burden.py \\
        local/data/audain2026/41525_2026_582_MOESM4_ESM.xlsx mirrors/burden.tsv

The workbook is not committed: `local/` is gitignored because these are journal
supplementary files whose redistribution terms are the article's rather than the
data's, and because the reviewable artifact is the extracted TSV. Provenance
travels as the URL and the sha256 this script prints, recorded in
`mirrors/sources.yaml`.

WHAT WAS MEASURED, 2026-08-04, against the real workbook
--------------------------------------------------------
Supplementary Data 3 has four sheets: an Info sheet, then `aCHD_vs_controls`
(46,342 rows), `sCHD_vs_controls` (46,081) and `nsCHD_vs_controls` (46,186).
Each carries all four carrier counts, and the three differ only in which
comparison the `fet.*` columns describe. That mapping was verified
arithmetically rather than assumed: recomputing the odds ratio as
(a/(N-a))/(c/(M-c)) agreed with the published value on 32,464 / 22,992 / 27,788
testable rows for the matching stratum with **zero** disagreements. Every
mismatched pairing disagreed on tens of thousands of rows. Only the zero is
quoted as a figure: it is stable at every tolerance from 1e-2 to 5e-2, whereas
the disagreement counts move with the tolerance, and an earlier draft of this
docstring quoted a range no single tolerance reproduces.

`maf` is `1E-3` and `analysis` is the sheet's own stratum, both constant within
a sheet. Denominators are constant too -- 3,876 cases (1,471 syndromic + 2,405
non-syndromic) against 45,082 controls -- and do **not** match the abstract's
4,747 / 52,881. The paper does not reconcile the gap: it says it "assembled an
exome dataset consisting of 57,628 samples (4747 CHD cases and 52,881
controls)" and never states 3,876, 1,471 or 2,405 anywhere. So the reason for
the difference is unstated, and this docstring does not invent one -- an earlier
draft called 4,747 "the pre-QC recruitment figure", which the paper does not
say. What is certain is which numbers the published odds ratios were computed
from, and those are the ones the mirror carries.

`Infinity` is the only non-numeric value anywhere in the four statistic columns:
448 + 187 + 292 = 927 rows, always in `fet.odds_ratio` and `fet.ci_95_upper`
together, where no control carried. Those rows hold the study's strongest
results, so they are published with a null effect and `effect_bound =
unbounded_above` rather than dropped or given an invented ceiling. Zero rows
have an inverted confidence interval.

EXCEL HAS CORRUPTED 25 GENE SYMBOLS IN THIS WORKBOOK
-----------------------------------------------------
`SYMBOL` holds 25 values matching `\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}` -- `2001-03-01`,
`2001-09-01`, `2001-12-01` and so on. These are the classic MARCH/SEPT/DEC
autocorrection: a spreadsheet read `MARCH1` as a date. It is irreversible from
this file, because `MARCH1` and `MARC1` collapse to the same cell value, which
is why four (SYMBOL, csq_group) pairs are duplicated in each sheet.

None of the 25 resolves to an in-scope gene, so nothing this atlas publishes is
lost today. `_report` names them anyway, and loudly: if a future workbook
corrupts a symbol that *is* in scope, that gene's entire burden evidence would
vanish from the mirror with a green build and no error -- this project's
characteristic failure exactly. A silent drop is the thing to prevent; a named
one is a curator's decision.
