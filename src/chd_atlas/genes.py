"""The one place a gene symbol becomes an HGNC id. Issue #33.

**Every cross-source join in this atlas keys on HGNC id, never on symbol**, and
this module exists so that a source which publishes symbols alone can be brought
onto that key in exactly one place, under exactly one set of rules.

The owner's instruction, 2026-08-06:

> there will be a lot of gene mapping across sources. you need to ensure this
> occur at the gene id level and not at the gene symbol name, since the later is
> more prone to mismatch due to aliases.

The hazard is measured, not hypothetical. Across the two committed validity
mirrors (2026-08-14) **six HGNC ids carry two different symbols**, because
ClinGen and GenCC disagree about the approved name for one gene: HGNC:1152
(`BVES`/`POPDC1`), HGNC:17272 (`CENPJ`/`CPAP`), HGNC:17861
(`IFT54`/`TRAF3IP1`), HGNC:26742 (`ASPNAT`/`NAT8L`), HGNC:28178
(`CCDC115`/`VMA22`) and HGNC:7687 (`COXFA4`/`NDUFA4`). A symbol-keyed map built
first-seen-wins picks whichever the read order surfaced, which is silent and not
even stable across a change in read order.

**An unresolved symbol is reported, never dropped.** That is the load-bearing
rule and the reason `resolve` returns a `Resolution` rather than `str | None`: a
caller that cannot tell "no such symbol" from "this symbol names two genes"
cannot report either, and a gene that fails to map and simply vanishes is
precisely the silent evidence loss this project treats as its characteristic
failure -- the build stays green and the gene is not there.

**Ambiguity is refused, never guessed.** `scripts/convert_burden.py` declines to
match aliases at all, and its stated reason is exactly right: "an alias that is
another gene's current symbol would silently attribute one gene's burden to
another". Measured against the committed registry, that collision does not occur
today -- 154 approved symbols, 309 alias symbols, **zero** overlap between the
two sets and **zero** aliases claimed by more than one gene -- but the guard is
structural rather than a bet on that staying true, because the registry is
regenerated from upstream and the number that matters is the one after the next
refresh.

**Three tiers, not two: approved, then alias, then previous.** `prev_symbols`
arrived with the mirror column of the same name; before it this module could
not resolve a retired name at all, which is what left `BVES` unresolvable while
ClinGen used it (the standing `GEN003`). Measured over the regenerated registry
on 2026-08-24 -- 154 approved, 309 alias, **69 distinct** previous symbols
across 56 genes:

- `approved & alias` and `approved & previous` are both **empty**.
- `alias & previous` holds exactly one string, **`ODD`**: a live alias of GJA1
  (HGNC:4274) and the retired name of OSR1 (HGNC:8111). It is the whole reason
  the previous symbols are a *third* tier rather than more entries in the alias
  map. Merged, `ODD` is claimed twice and resolves to nothing; ranked, the live
  alias wins, which is what a source writing `ODD` today means. HGNC retires a
  name into `prev_symbol` and leaves the live synonyms in `alias_symbol`, so
  "currently used" beating "formerly official" is the upstream's own semantics
  rather than a preference invented here.
- **`MADH7`** is claimed by two genes *within* the previous tier -- SMAD6
  (HGNC:6772) and SMAD7 (HGNC:6773) both retired it -- and is refused, exactly
  as an ambiguous alias would be. Precedence resolves *between* tiers; it never
  breaks a tie inside one.

**A tier is consulted only when every tier above it is silent, and an ambiguous
tier stops the search.** A symbol two genes claim as an alias must not be
quietly answered by some third gene's retired name: that would turn a reportable
collision into a confident wrong id, which is the failure this module exists to
prevent.

    **Approved symbols win over aliases, which win over previous symbols, and
    the precedence is not a tie-break to be tidied away.** HGNC retires a symbol
    by making it a *previous* symbol of the gene that kept the name, so a string
    that is one gene's approved symbol and another's alias names the first gene
    today. Resolving to the alias would attribute a row to a gene the source did
    not mean. The same argument one rung down puts a live alias ahead of a
