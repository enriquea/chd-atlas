def slug(value: str) -> str:
    r"""A path-safe form of one identifier.

    Injective *as a function on strings*, over the ASCII values of every grammar
    in `identifiers.py` but one. Within ASCII the only characters this rewrites
    are the colon and the underscore, and no two values differ solely by swapping
    the two: the underscore appears only in `ContrastId`, which admits no
    capital, while every grammar bearing a colon starts with one. The hyphen and
    the dot are left alone, which is what keeps that list of two complete.

    Distinct strings are not distinct filenames, and the gap is not academic:
    the sole thing separating that worst-case pair is case, which is exactly what
    a case-insensitive filesystem discards. `HGNC:11604` (an `HgncId`) and
    `hgnc_11604` (a `ContrastId`) slug to "HGNC_11604" and "hgnc_11604", two
    files on the Linux CI and one on a curator's APFS. `Emitter._write` does not
    backstop the string-level guarantee here — its duplicate check compares
    Python strings — so it carries a second, casefolded check for this. Nothing
    can collide today regardless, because `gene_bundle_path` is the only path
    constructor in this module and only `HgncId` reaches it.

    The excepted grammar is `Doi` (`^10\.\d{4,9}/\S+$`), whose suffix admits
    every non-whitespace character, so "10.1000/ab/cd", "10.1000/ab:cd" and
    "10.1000/ab_cd" all reduce to one slug. Nothing builds a path from a DOI, and
    anything that starts to needs a rule that encodes rather than substitutes.

    "Within ASCII" is load-bearing rather than pedantic. `\d` is Unicode-aware in
    both Python's `re` and the rust engine pydantic validates with, so
    "HGNC:1160" suffixed with an Arabic-indic one and the same with an
    Arabic-indic two are two distinct values that `HgncId` accepts and that share
    the slug "HGNC_1160_". `\d` appears in every grammar but `ContrastId` —
    alone in spelling its alphabet out as `[a-z0-9]` — so this is not a corner of
    the schema: it reaches `HgncId`, the one grammar `gene_bundle_path` exists to
    serve. Two things keep it from quietly costing a gene page, neither of them
    this function: no curated file contains a non-ASCII digit today, and
    `Emitter._write` raises on the second write to a path rather than replacing
    the first, so a collision fails the build instead of publishing one page
    where two were expected. Note that the first of those is an observation
    about the data, not an invariant anything enforces.

    Three things the string-level claim does not cover, each with its own test:
    `Doi`, any non-ASCII value of any grammar, and the case collision above. A
    grammar added to `identifiers.py` and not to the sample fails
    `test_the_sample_covers_every_grammar_that_exists`, which is the intended
    outcome: only a reader can decide whether the argument above survives it.

    `HgncId` rather than `str` so that the one sentence above holding the case
    collision at bay — only `HgncId` reaches this — is enforced by mypy instead
    of remembered: mypy rejects both the colliding `ContrastId` and a bare `str`.
    `slug` itself stays `str`, because vocabulary values such as `Zygosity`'s
    "n/a" belong to no grammar and must still be able to reach it.
