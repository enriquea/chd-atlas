# src/chd_atlas/build/bundles.py
"""The gene index and the per-gene bundles.

A bundle is what replaces a backend: a gene detail page is one fetch of one
small file, joined here so that no client ever has to assemble a gene's
assertions, functional records, variants and omics summaries itself.

`genes/index.json` is the other half: the browse payload, downloaded by every
visitor before they have picked a gene. It carries what the browser ranks and
filters on plus the path to fetch the rest, and none of the evidence itself —
that is what keeps it small as curation grows, and why the bundle is a separate
file rather than a section of this one.

Two rules decide what goes where.

A contested gene must never be displayed as settled. `strongest()` ranks
classifications on one linear scale where `definitive` outranks `refuted`, while
ClinGen treats disputed and refuted as a separate axis rather than weaker rungs
of the same ladder, so `headline_confidence` on its own hides a refutation
behind a stronger assertion about the same gene. `has_conflicting_evidence` is
the other half of that pair; `_headline` below is the single place either is
written, so a payload cannot come to carry the confidence without the flag.

Every path the index advertises must be a file that was written. `bundle` is the
URL a detail page is fetched from, and nothing downstream can catch a wrong one:
`Emitter.checksums` records what the build wrote, never what a payload promised,
so a dead link is published with every checksum verifying and every gate green.
One `gene_bundle_path` call per gene supplies both the index entry and the
write, which is what makes the two agree by construction rather than by review.

    filename — `_record_files` sorts the glob — and then each file's own order

    The return is `gene_facts`' mapping, handed back rather than discarded so
    that `build_gene_pages` and `build_gene_index_page` render from the same
    derivation these bundles were written from. Deriving it a second time in the
    runner would type-check, cost another pass over the corpus, and leave two
    call sites free to drift apart — a page and the bundle it links to
    disagreeing about a gene's confidence is exactly the failure `_headline`
    exists to make unrepresentable within one payload, and it would reappear
    between payloads. Returning it does not widen what this function promises:
    the mapping is `gene_facts`' own return, keyed on the same population, and
    this function does not mutate it.

    `published` is D21's population: `build.validity.published_genes()`'s
    return, the genes a ClinGen expert panel classifies `Limited` or better for
    an in-scope disease, plus the genes two or more GenCC submitters agree on
    that no ClinGen panel contests. It is passed to `gene_facts`, which keys on
    it, so this function writes exactly one bundle per member and the index lists
    exactly the same set. 91 of the 92 published today carry no curated assertion
    at all; `atlas_curation` is what says so, in the index row and the bundle
    alike.

    `symbols` comes from `mirrors/genes.tsv`, keyed on HGNC id. A gene absent
    from it keeps its HGNC id as its display label: the browse row and the page
    heading both render this value, so blank reads as a broken site while
    "HGNC:4173" reads as a symbol that has not been mirrored yet and is still
    something a reader can search for.

    `validity` is passed straight to `gene_facts` — see its docstring for what
    a gene absent from it publishes. The bundle additionally embeds the whole
    `GeneValidity` as a `validity` object (`_validity`), which `gene_facts`
    does not carry forward because the browse layer never needs the individual
    mirrored records, only the fields it already reduces `GeneValidity` to.

    `omics` and `variants` are what `build_omics` and `build_variants` returned,
    taken as `Mapping` because nothing here mutates them. Genes they carry that
    are outside `published` are ignored, which is the same rule `gene_facts`
    applies: no external authority has admitted them under D21, so the atlas
    publishes no page for them. Their rows are still published in the shards
    those two modules wrote — the gene index simply does not link to them.

    That last sentence covers `omics` and `variants` and nothing else. A
    `FunctionalEvidence` record about a gene outside `published` is worse off: no
    other build module reads `corpus.functional` — `derive.py` reads it only to
    count records per gene, and this is its only writer — so it reaches no
    published file at all rather than an unlinked one. That is evidence loss,
    not a missing link. It still does not raise here, because such a record is
    legal under every validator in the project and `gene_facts` is what decides
    which genes exist; the cost is pinned instead, by
    `test_a_gene_with_evidence_but_outside_the_published_set_is_not_published`.
