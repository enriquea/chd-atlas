# src/chd_atlas/build/profiles.py
"""The figures this atlas derives from a developmental transcriptome.

Neither figure is a mirror column. The build derives both from the two
published tables, so a consumer's re-derivation and the build's are the same
arithmetic over the same bytes -- the pattern `omics.py` uses for `genes`,
where `count` is built from the attribution the rows publish so the two cannot
drift. Emitting them as columns instead would mean two computations of each
number with no way to tell which is right.

D39(b) is a one-level guarantee, not an unbounded one: a gene's percentile is
re-derivable from its median and the published breakpoints; the breakpoints
are not, because D32 forbids publishing the matrix they came from. Stated as a
trade rather than claimed as a proof.

This module carries the percentile band (Task 9), tau (Task 10), phase
assignment (Task 11), quantile shard emission (Task 12), the per-gene
assembly that reads both mirrors and turns them into one `ExpressionProfile`
per gene (Task 13), and `percentile_annotations` (Task 8b). Task 12 is the
other half of D39(b)'s bargain: Task 9's percentile is re-derivable only if
the breakpoints it was read against are themselves fetchable, and
`build_omics` never emits this table -- it skips every schema absent from its
own `_GENE_COLUMN`, and a quantile grid has no gene column at all.

`percentile_annotations` is the other half of a different bargain: `omics.py`
ranks a `profiles` row's stratified slice on the percentile the row is never
told at read time, so this module hands the figure back out, flattened, from
the exact `Placement`s Task 13 already computed -- read once here, never
derived a second time. See that function's own docstring.

Task 13's join is deliberately a LEFT join on (dataset, tissue, stage), never
an inner one. `profiles.stage` is nullable and `profile_quantiles.stage` is
not (see `tables.py`'s own comment on that column), so a null-stage row can
never have a quantile partner *by construction* -- an inner join drops it
silently (measured: two rows in, one out, no error), while a left join keeps
it and states why it carries no percentile. `ProfileGap` is that stated
reason, published as a slug rather than a rendered sentence: the exact wording
a reader sees is `build/pages.py`'s job (a later task), and baking English
prose into this payload would make the atlas author phrasing here that a page
might need to phrase two different ways.

    is what makes a page's wording safe -- tau measures concentration, not
    location, so an organ-naming gloss keyed on tau alone can state the

    tau = sum(1 - x_i/x_max) / (n - 1), computed on `x = log2(median + 1)`.
    Measured: a 10-fold enriched gene (heart 100, six organs at 10) scores
    0.900 on linear RPKM -- "tissue-specific" -- and 0.480 on log2 --
    "broadly expressed". Yanai et al. 2005 and the Kryuchkova-Mostacci &
    Robinson-Rechavi benchmark both compute tau on log expression; computing
    on linear would publish a number that reads tissue-specific for ordinary
    genes across the board.

    Returns `None`, never `0.0`, when tau is undefined:

    - fewer than two organs were sampled at this stage (the denominator is
      `n - 1`), or
    - the gene's peak across every sampled organ is below `floor` (the
      normaliser is `x_max`, and computing one from an unreliable peak would
      publish a ratio measured against noise).

    A genuinely ubiquitous gene -- every organ equal -- measures *exactly*
    0.000, so a guard that defaults an undefined tau to `0.0` (`n < 2`, or
    `except ZeroDivisionError`) publishes "expressed identically everywhere"
    for a gene measured in a single organ -- the opposite claim, and it lands
    on the earliest stages, where the organ panel is smallest.

    The peak's floor comparison is `peak_raw < floor`, strictly -- the same
    comparison `placement` uses (D41), so one gene cannot read "detected"
    under one figure and "below the floor" under the other from the same
    value; pinned at the boundary by `test_the_floor_gate_on_tau_is_strict_
    less_than`, matching Task 9's own boundary test.

    **The floor gates whether tau is published at all. It does not change
    what any organ contributes once tau is computed.** A non-peak organ
    below the floor is retained in `tissues`/`n_tissues` (so those keep
    meaning "organs sampled", not "organs detected" -- dropping is
    self-defeating, since the most heart-exclusive gene in the atlas,
    detected in heart alone, would fall to n=1 and lose tau entirely), *and
    its raw median is used in the sum exactly as measured* -- not floored to
    zero. An earlier version of this function floored it, reasoning that a
    sub-floor value is unreliable noise. Reverted on review, for two reasons:

    1. D39(b) requires tau to be re-derivable from the `medians` this same
       payload publishes, and `medians` is (and was always) published raw.
       Flooring internally while publishing raw inputs makes those two
       requirements contradict each other: a consumer who recomputes tau
       from the published `medians` gets a different number than the one
       published beside them (measured: 0.696 re-derived vs. 0.740
       published, same fixture). `test_tau_is_re_derivable_from_its_own_
       published_medians` makes this a checked invariant rather than a claim
       nobody watches.
    2. Flooring is not a neutral rounding choice: it measurably *raises*
       tau (0.740 vs. 0.696 on that same fixture -- `test_a_below_floor_
       nonzero_value_uses_its_raw_median_not_a_floored_zero`), pushing
       toward a stronger specificity claim than the data supports, in the
       same direction tau's own single-organ normaliser is already biased
       toward. Where two readings of an under-specified rule differ, this
       atlas takes the one that claims less.

    "Below the detection floor" means the source does not vouch for the
    value as a detection -- it does not mean the source measured zero, and
    substituting zero for it is this atlas authoring a number the source did
    not report (the act D12/D39 exist to forbid). Gating *publication* on
    the floor and *rewriting a value* because of it are different acts; this
    function does the first and, deliberately, not the second.

    The one rewrite tau's arithmetic does make is a negative median, clamped
    to zero before the log transform: a negative abundance is not a value,
    and `log2` of one is not a number. `test_a_negative_median_is_clamped_
    to_zero_before_log2` pins this, including that it does not raise.

    `medians` is published alongside because the bundle's own slice of a
    gene's organs is truncated elsewhere (`omics.select_top`), and D39(b)
    requires tau's actual inputs to be reachable from the same payload that
    carries tau.

    """Publish every quantile grid, so a percentile this atlas derives can be checked.

    D39(b) is unmet without this. A gene page states a percentile whose input
    is the whole source transcriptome (tens of thousands of genes), and D32
    forbids re-hosting that matrix -- so `mirrors/profile_quantiles/<accession>.tsv`
    exists solely to publish the 101 breakpoints a consumer needs to place any
    abundance and reproduce the number themselves. `build_omics` never emits
    it: that function skips every schema absent from its own `_GENE_COLUMN`
    (`omics.py`'s `if schema_name not in _GENE_COLUMN: continue`), and a
    quantile grid has no gene column -- there is no gene to attribute a
    breakpoint row to. Without this function the table is mirrored,
    schema-validated, sort-checked and sha256'd, and reaches no published
    byte: the one file whose entire purpose is auditability would be the one
    thing a consumer could not fetch, and nothing would catch it -- the
    validators check the mirror against itself, `percentile_of`'s arithmetic
    is tested against unpublished input either way, and a `diff -rq` between
    two builds shows a file that appears, never one that should have.

    Emits `omics/profile_quantiles/<accession>.json` as
    `{"table": "profile_quantiles", "rows": [...]}` -- the same envelope
    `build_omics` writes for its own shards, so a consumer reads one shape
    regardless of which table it fetched. The accession is the shard's own
    filename stem, exactly as `build_omics` reads a dataset accession from a
    `profiles`/`expression`/`proteomics`/`phospho` shard's name; it is put
    through `paths.slug` for the same reason every shard stem is -- the stem
    becomes a URL, and a space or a colon in one would need escaping before it
    could be fetched.

    Rows are sorted by the table's own canonical `sort_key`
    (`dataset, tissue, stage, percentile`) before being written, never trusted
    to already be in that order: `read_table` preserves a TSV's file order
    verbatim (`pl.read_csv`, no grouping or sort of its own), so an unsorted
    row order on disk would otherwise publish unsorted, silently, on a build
    that never re-validates a mirror it has already read. Sorting on the full
    key rather than on `percentile` alone matters the moment one shard holds
    more than one `(tissue, stage)` grid, which is the ordinary shape for a
    real dataset (many organs, many stages) rather than the single-grid shape
    of the test fixture -- sorting on `percentile` alone would interleave
    every grid in the shard by breakpoint value instead of keeping each one
    contiguous and internally ordered.

    Shards are emitted in `mirror_paths`' own order, which is sorted by
    filename -- so two builds of one commit write these files in the same
    order, though (unlike row order within one file) that has no bearing on
    any file's *content*.

    Returns `{dataset accession: relative shard path}`. Read by
    `gene_expression_profiles` below, which threads a gene's
    `expression_profile` bundle key to the grid its percentile came from, the
    way `ModalitySummary.shards` lets a gene bundle reach an omics shard
    today. Returning the exact path this function wrote -- rather than
    leaving the caller to reconstruct it via a second call to `slug` -- is
    what keeps that link from becoming a second computation that could drift
    from the first, the same discipline `omics.py`'s own module docstring
    states for `count`.

    restricts what reaches a bundle, by iterating `published` alone, and

    which genes exist.

    **Both figures are restricted to `published`, with no exception.** Unlike
    `burden_census`'s `families` -- deliberately left unrestricted because a
    cohort family is a property of the corpus's sample collections, and
    dropping one whose studies tested no published gene can split it into
    what then reads as two independent datasets (D33) -- a profile dataset
    carries no such connectedness to protect. There is no reason for either
    figure here to read wider than what a consumer can actually reach.

    `genes` counts published genes whose `expression_profile` is non-empty --
    never `len(profiles)`. `gene_expression_profiles` returns an entry for
    every gene `mirrors/profiles/*.tsv` mentions "published or not" (its own
    docstring), the same 154-vs-92 asymmetry `mirrors/genes.tsv` already has
    for burden, so counting the mapping directly would advertise
    developmental-expression evidence behind genes this API publishes no
    bundle for.

    `datasets` counts the distinct dataset accessions named by those same
    genes' own `expression_profile.datasets` entries -- never
    `len(corpus.datasets)`, which already means something else: *every*
    registered omics dataset, `profile`-design and `contrast`-design alike,
    with no restriction to `published` at all (that count predates this
    layer and is deliberately left as-is; see `manifest.py`'s schema-history
    comment for 2.11). Two keys both named "datasets" and both meaning
    something different is exactly the confusion `cohort_families` was kept
    apart from `independent_datasets` to avoid, so this counts only
    accessions actually reachable from a published gene's own bundle.

    This paragraph read "both figures are 0 on every corpus this atlas has
    built so far -- no `profiles` mirror has ever been committed" until
    2026-08-20. `mirrors/profiles/E-MTAB-6814.tsv` landed on 2026-08-19 and
    both figures moved: measured on the committed corpus, `genes` is 92 and
    `datasets` is 1.

    **The fixture is still what proves the restriction, for a narrower
    reason.** One wrong implementation is now visible on a real build and one
    is not. Counting the mirror gives 154, because
    `mirrors/profiles/E-MTAB-6814.tsv` covers every registered gene; reading
    `len(published)` and `len(corpus.datasets)` gives 92 and 1, which is
    exactly what a correct implementation publishes. Two figures that are
    equal today are one figure to every test (CLAUDE.md section 4.30), so the
    case that separates them is hand-built: a gene outside `published`, and a
    dataset only that gene cites. See `tests/unit/test_build_profiles.py`.
