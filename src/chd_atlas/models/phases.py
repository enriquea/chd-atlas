"""The cardiac morphogenetic phases a developmental stage can fall in.

This is the first developmental-biology claim in the atlas, and it is
transcribed rather than authored: every phase carries the source that defines
its boundaries. `chd_scope.yaml` is the precedent (`cohorts.yaml` is not --
measured 2026-08-14, it carries no attribution at all).

Intervals are half-open, `[start_wpc, end_wpc)`, so a stage sitting exactly on
a boundary falls in exactly one phase's own edge case rather than a coin flip.

**A stage may carry SEVERAL phases at once, and this is a fact about the
biology, not a modelling looseness.** An earlier version of this file enforced
a disjoint partition -- one phase per stage -- and that was wrong. Human
cardiac morphogenetic processes run concurrently; a disjoint partition would
force picking one label per stage and silently discarding the others, and the
discarded one may be exactly the lesion-relevant process a reader came for.

**This table was corrected once and the correction is recorded here on
purpose.** It originally read "4 | looping, atrial septation, ventricular
septation" and so on, transcribed from the source's *ordinal*-week prose --
which is exactly the off-by-one-week error this file's own next section warns
against, and it produced a wrong row (it placed outflow tract septation at 7
wpc; the numeric boundaries below place it only through 6.86 wpc). The table
below is derived from the boundaries `curation/cardiac_phases.yaml` actually
curates, verified against a real built page rather than trusted by
arithmetic, and `heart_looping` is absent from every row on purpose -- it has
no stated end (see `EndBasis.NOT_STATED` below) and `phases_for` excludes it
from every match for exactly that reason, even though it is also
biologically underway throughout this range:

| elapsed wpc | phases matched |
|---|---|
| 4 | atrial septation, ventricular septation |
| 6 | atrial septation, ventricular septation, outflow tract septation |
| 7 | ventricular septation, valve formation |

At 6 wpc an AVSD gene needs "atrial septation" and a TGA gene needs "outflow
tract septation", and both are true at once -- a disjoint model can represent
only one of them. So `CardiacPhaseFile` enforces unique phase **ids** only; it
does not, and must not, enforce that phases are pairwise disjoint.

**Boundaries are computed from HsapDv day-post-fertilization ranges (day /
7.0), never transcribed from a source's ordinal-week prose.** A source stating
"the sixth week of development" means elapsed wpc **5 to 6** (ordinal week N
spans elapsed (N-1) to N), not 6 to 7 -- HsapDv gives Carnegie stage 16 as day
37-42 (5.29-6.00 elapsed wpc), and Buijtendijk et al. 2020 calls CS16 "the
sixth week", which is consistent with the ordinal reading and NOT with reading
"sixth week" as elapsed wpc 6-7. Transcribing the prose directly would shift
every boundary a full Carnegie stage too late, silently and consistently
enough that nothing downstream would catch it -- exactly the kind of error
this file's own docstring exists to name rather than let recur, and exactly
the error the table above was corrected from. See `curation/cardiac_
phases.yaml`'s header comment for the same warning at the point a curator is
most likely to re-introduce it.

    """Where a phase's `end_wpc` comes from: the source, an ontology, or nowhere.

    **A retired member first, because the third one below has to be read
    against it.** An earlier revision had `CURATOR_CAPPED`, for a phase the
    source names no end for -- "capped" at the last Carnegie stage the source
    discusses at all, on the reasoning that the heart "already resembles the
    postnatal configuration" by then. That statement turned out to describe
    arterial-pole remodelling, not any of the three processes it was used to
    cap, and was this atlas inventing a boundary the source never gave -- once
    for a genuine gap (`heart_looping`) and twice for phases whose real
    completion had simply not been extracted yet
    (`ventricular_septum_morphogenesis`, `heart_valve_morphogenesis` -- both
    now `STATED`, at the source's own words). It is retired rather than kept
    unused: a vocabulary member no curated phase exercises is a guard nobody
    has seen fail.

    - `STATED` -- the source names this boundary directly. Every end field
      (`end_wpc`, `end_carnegie_stage`, `end_hsapdv_id`) is populated.
    - `DERIVED` -- the boundary is not in the source's prose, but follows from
      the phase's **own ontology term** plus a boundary this file already
      carries as `STATED`. Every end field is populated, exactly as for
      `STATED`, and the two are kept apart so a reader can tell which
      sentences came from the cited paper and which this atlas concluded.
    - `NOT_STATED` -- nothing gives an end. Every end field is `None`.

    `CardiacPhase.end_fields_match_end_basis` enforces the pairing in both
    directions, so the basis and the fields can never disagree.

    **`DERIVED` is not `CURATOR_CAPPED` under a new name, and the difference is
    the whole reason it is allowed.** `CURATOR_CAPPED` took a statement about a
    *different* process and applied it to this one; there was no relation
    between the sentence and the boundary beyond both appearing in the same
    paper. `DERIVED` requires an actual entailment, and the live case is the
    only kind that qualifies: GO:0001947 -- the term `heart_looping` already
    carries in its own `go_id` -- *defines* the process as ending "preceding
    septation", and this file already dates the start of septation at CS12
    from the source, `end_basis: stated`. The end is not a guess at what the
    paper might have meant; it is what the phase's own definition says, read
    against a boundary already curated here.

    A `DERIVED` end is still weaker than a `STATED` one and must stay
    visible as such: it inherits every uncertainty of the boundary it is
    anchored to, and it would move if that anchor moved. A future phase whose
    end follows from nothing at all is `NOT_STATED`, with `end_wpc` left null
    rather than a boundary invented to fill it -- that is what this vocabulary
    exists to make expressible.
