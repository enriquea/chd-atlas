# src/chd_atlas/validate/profiles.py
"""Cross-table rules for ``mirrors/profiles/`` and ``mirrors/profile_quantiles/``.

`validate_table` checks each shard against its own column declarations and
cannot see that the two tables are two views of one measurement: a gene's
`median_abundance` only means something once it is placed inside the
distribution `profile_quantiles` describes for that same
`(dataset, tissue, stage)`, and that placement is only valid when both tables
agree on what they are measuring. Four ways that agreement can silently break:

- **The unit.** `unit` is `allowed` per cell (TBL005), not per dataset, so
  nothing stops one dataset reporting `rpkm` for one organ and `tpm` for
  another (**PRF008**), or `profiles` and `profile_quantiles` naming the same
  dataset in two different units (**PRF001**). Either way, a median gets read
  against a ruler marked in the wrong quantity -- the 40th percentile of a
  TPM distribution is not the 40th percentile of an RPKM one.
- **The cell.** A gene's median is placed against the breakpoints for its own
  `(dataset, tissue, stage)`. A triple with `profiles` rows and no
  `profile_quantiles` rows (**PRF002**) has nothing to be placed against.
- **The ruler.** `profile_quantiles` publishes 101 breakpoints per triple,
  meant to be read as a monotone lookup table. A breakpoint that decreases
  (**PRF003**) means the 40th percentile is a smaller number than the 30th,
  and a gene whose value straddles the inversion gets a percentile that
  depends on which side of a coin flip the lookup lands on.

**`profiles.stage` is nullable; `profile_quantiles.stage` is not** -- a
quantile grid always names the stage it summarises, so a null-stage `profiles`
row can never have a quantile partner *by construction*. PRF002 skips those
rows rather than reporting a design fact as a curation error once per tissue
on every dataset that has one. The row itself is not this function's to drop;
whatever later joins the two tables is expected to left-join so the row still
publishes, with a null percentile. Both halves matter for the same reason a
skipped check and a dropped row are different failures: skip the check alone
and a real gap still reads the same as this permitted one; keep the row alone
and there is nothing here to tell the two apart, which is how a curator learns
to stop reading PRF002 at all.

**A `profile_quantiles` mirror that is missing or entirely unreadable is not
reported here.** Comparing `profiles` against a table that never loaded would
flag every `(dataset, tissue, stage)` in `profiles` as a gap and every
dataset's unit as disagreeing -- the same cascade `REF000`/`SRC000`/`ONT000`
exist to prevent for a curated registry that failed to load. When no
`profile_quantiles` shard could be read at all, PRF001 and PRF002 are silently
skipped here rather than cascading; naming that skip so a report cannot go
quietly green over it is a separate check, added together with the runner
wiring that calls this module.

Reference checks against other registries (a gene id, a declared cardiac
tissue or stage token, a curated phase vocabulary) live in
`validate_profile_references` below, kept separate for the same reason
`validate_burden_references` is separate from `validate_burden`: one
unreadable registry must not be able to take these table-internal checks
down with it.

Every check here reports rather than raises, per the project's split:
validators collect issues, and `build_site` is what refuses.

    consistency checks with it. This function does its own pass over
    `profiles`/`profile_quantiles` rather than sharing state with
    `validate_profiles`, matching how `validate_burden_references` re-reads
    `mirrors/burden.tsv` independently of `validate_burden`.

    `known_genes` is `None` when the gene registry did not load, and every
    gene check (PRF007) is then skipped rather than reporting each row as
    dangling -- the cascade REF000/SRC000/ONT000 exist to prevent. It is
    deliberately distinct from an empty-but-loaded registry (a header-only
    `mirrors/genes.tsv`), which correctly flags every gene as unknown; the
    skip is an `is not None` check for exactly that reason, never a truthy
    one, since an empty `set` is falsy.

    `published_genes` is a different set from `known_genes` and the two must
    not be conflated: `known_genes` is the whole gene registry (every gene
    this atlas has an id for), `published_genes` is the population that
    clears the publication gate (`build.validity.published_genes()`'s
    return). PRF007 checks the profiles column against the registry, because
    an unregistered id is a shape problem regardless of what publishes;
    PRF009 checks a gap against the published population, because a gene
    absent from a cell only matters to a reader once it has a page to be
    absent *from*.

    Five codes:

    - **PRF004** (ERROR) -- a dataset's declared `cardiac_tissues` token
      matched by no `profiles` row for that dataset.
    - **PRF005** (ERROR) -- a `profiles.stage` token a dataset's own record
      does not declare in `stages`.
    - **PRF006** (WARNING) -- an interior gap no declared cardiac phase
      covers; see `_prf006_issues` for why only interior gaps, and only a
      warning.
    - **PRF007** (ERROR) -- a `profiles.gene` id in no gene registry.
    - **PRF009** (WARNING) -- a published gene missing a `profiles` row in a
      `(dataset, tissue, stage)` cell that `profile_quantiles` shows was
      actually assayed; see `_prf009_issues` for the grouping choice.

    PRF004/005/007 are errors because each names a claim the corpus makes
    that its own mirrors do not back up (a declaration with no data, data
    with no declaration, an id naming nothing). PRF009 is a warning because a
    gene missing from one source matrix is ordinary -- the burden layer's
    nine registered genes absent from the Audain supplement are the
    precedent -- and the point is to name the gap, not to block the build
    over it.

    **Why a merge, not a pairwise-adjacent comparison.** Before phases could
    overlap, "sort by start, compare each phase only to the very next one"
    was already a correct interior-gap test, because no phase could ever
    reach past its immediate successor. Once phases may overlap
    (`models/phases.py`'s module docstring), that stops being true: a long
    phase can span past several shorter ones nested or overlapping inside it,
    and comparing only *adjacent-in-sort-order* phases would then report a
    false gap between two short phases that a third, wider phase already
    covers. Worked example: `A=[1,10)`, `B=[2,3)`, `C=[8,9)` sorts as
    `A, B, C`; comparing `B` to `C` directly sees `C.start (8) > B.end (3)`
    and reports a gap that does not exist, because `A` already covers all of
    `[1,10)`, `B` and `C` included. Merging into spans first is what keeps
    the check correct once overlap is legal, not merely unchanged for the
    non-overlapping case it used to be the only case.

    A phase merges into the running span when its own start falls at or
    before the span's current end (`<=`, matching the half-open-interval
    "touching is not a gap" rule the old pairwise check already used); the
    span's end then becomes the *later* of the two ends, never simply
    replaced, so a short phase nested inside a longer one cannot shrink the
    span back down. Each span's `phase_ids` names every phase merged into it,
    sorted by `(start_wpc, id)` via the traversal order -- `_prf006_issues`
    re-sorts them again before rendering, so this function does not need to

    **Redefined for overlap.** Phases may now overlap by design
    (`models/phases.py`'s module docstring), so "gap" can no longer mean "the
    space between one phase and the very next in sorted order" -- that
    pairwise reading misfires once a wider phase can span past a nested,
    narrower one; see `_coverage_spans` for a worked counter-example. A gap is
    instead a wpc region strictly between the earliest start and the latest
    end that **no phase, individually, reaches** -- computed by merging every
    phase into maximal coverage spans first (`_coverage_spans`) and reporting
    only between two *spans*, never between two raw phases.

    Never the region before the first phase or after the last: a curated
    window legitimately stops before the post-natal stages (a null-wpc stage
    is post-natal *by construction*, per `Stage.wpc`), so firing there would
    trigger on every correct vocabulary -- and a check that fires on every
    correct input is a check a curator learns to ignore. `phases=None` (no
    vocabulary curated yet) skips this entirely, the same treatment
    `validate_profiles` gives an unread `profile_quantiles` mirror; an empty

    of an empty sequence is `[]` and the pairwise loop below is then a no-op.

    """PRF009 -- a published gene missing a profiles row in a cell that was assayed.

    Inverts PRF002's question. `profile_quantiles` records which
    `(dataset, tissue, stage)` cells were actually assayed; for each one, a
    published gene with no `profiles` row there was *dropped*, not merely
    unsampled -- a distinction `tau` cannot make, since it only ever sees the
    rows that exist. WARNING, not ERROR: a gene absent from a source matrix is
    ordinary on its own (the burden layer's nine registered genes missing
    from the Audain supplement are the precedent), and the point is to name
    the gap, not to block the build over it.

    Checked against `published_genes`, never `known_genes`: the two are
    different sets and this function must not conflate them. A merely
    registered gene missing from one cell is unremarkable -- most of the
    154-gene registry is not published at all -- while a *published* one is a
    gap on a page a reader can already reach.

    **Grouped by assayed cell, not by gene or by (gene, cell) pair.** The
    realistic failure this guards against -- a converter that drops a
    scattered subset of rows within one tissue/stage slice, such as dropped
    NA rows or a bad range in a copy-paste -- leaves every dropped gene
    sharing the *same* cell, so one issue per cell names the whole defect
    once, listing every gene missing there. Grouping by gene instead would
    split that single root cause into as many issues as genes it happened to
    drop; grouping by (gene, cell) pair would size the report at the product
    of published genes and assayed cells (92 x roughly 150 today -- up to
    13,800), which is the spam this choice exists to avoid. Bounded instead
    by the number of assayed cells alone. Pinned by
    `test_prf009_groups_by_assayed_cell_not_by_gene_or_by_row`.

    No `quantile_available`-style guard is needed here, unlike PRF001/PRF002
    in `validate_profiles`. Those subtract *from* the profiles side, so
    treating an unread quantile mirror as merely empty would make that
    subtraction return everything in `profiles` -- the false cascade the flag
    exists to stop. This function instead iterates `quantile_triples`
    *directly*: when no `profile_quantiles` shard could be read, that set is
    empty by construction, and the loop below is then simply a no-op. Pinned
    by `test_prf009_reports_nothing_when_no_quantile_shard_can_be_read`
    rather than left as reasoning nobody checked.

    `quantile_triples` is itself a `set` of 3-tuples, so its unsorted
    iteration order can follow PYTHONHASHSEED exactly like PRF002's
    `profile_triples - quantile_triples` in `validate_profiles` -- wrapping a
    value in a tuple does not remove that risk, it only changes the specific
    coincidence rate (measured: a five-word tissue set that never coincided
    with sorted order as bare strings measured a real, nonzero rate once
    wrapped as `(dataset, tissue, stage)`). `sorted(quantile_triples)` fixes
    that regardless of table layout, comparing the full triple
    lexicographically. Each message's missing-gene list is sorted for the
    same reason PRF004's is. See
    `test_prf009_issues_and_their_message_lists_are_sorted` for the measured
    rates behind the fixture size chosen there.
