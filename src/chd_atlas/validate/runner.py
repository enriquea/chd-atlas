    - an HGNC id -> every MONDO term it is curated under
    - a MONDO term -> every ClinGen expert panel that curated a record naming it
    - a MONDO term -> every GenCC submitter that did

    The last two are kept APART rather than merged into one set of names, and
    that separation is the whole of SCP005's strength. Merged, the check can
    only ask "did some authority use this term", so a curator may take a term
    whose sole warrant is a commercial laboratory's GenCC submission, label it
    `admitted_by: clingen_chd_panel`, and pass -- publishing on 24 pages that
    ClinGen's chartered panel scoped a disease it never curated. Found by
    adversarial review of #30, on the guard added in the same commit.

    mapping would report SCP001 once per term — 68 failures naming the

    `validate_profile_references` needs the *published* gene set, never the
    whole registry `_known_genes` returns — profiles.py's own docstring is
    explicit the two must not be conflated, since most of the registry is not
    published at all. The only correct source for that population is
    `build.validity.published_genes`, the same function `build_site` calls to
    decide what to publish. Reimplementing the gate's rules a second time here
    (which submitters count, the agreement floor, ClinGen's veto) would risk
    the two copies drifting apart the next time the gate widens — the same
    class of defect CLAUDE.md section 9 keeps `headline_confidence` and
    `has_conflicting_evidence` written together in one place to prevent.

    `validate/burden.py`'s BUR009-011 docstring declined to add the equivalent
    check for burden rows, because deriving the published set inside
    `validate/` "needs build.validity.published_genes and inverts the
    layering: the validator would depend on the builder it exists to gate."
    That general concern does not reproduce as an import cycle here:
    `chd_atlas.build.validity` imports only `chd_atlas.build.emit` and
    `chd_atlas.vocab`, and neither imports anything under `chd_atlas.validate`
    — `build.runner` already imports both `validate.runner` and
    `build.validity` today, in that order, with no cycle, and this module
    still imports cleanly on its own with the new import added. The choice
    actually being made here is between reusing the one correct
    implementation and duplicating a classification this involved; for a
    project this dependent on a single source of truth, duplication is the
    larger risk.

    **Never lets `gene_validity`/`published_genes` raise out of this
    function.** They are written for post-gate data — `build_site` calls them
    only after `validate_repository` has already reported 0 errors — and they
    are not defensive the way this module's own mirror readers are.
    Reproduced directly against synthetic frames: a column an upstream rename
    dropped (the same shape Copilot found in `_mirrored_validity`) raises
    `KeyError`, and a classification term the atlas vocabulary has not mapped
    yet raises `ValueError` by design (`gene_validity`'s own docstring: "a
    term either mirror adds in a later release must reach a human"). Both are
    the right behaviour for `build_site`, which must refuse rather than
    publish a confidence nobody vetted, and neither is acceptable here: this
    call computes one WARNING-level check's population, not a
    correctness-critical result, so degrading to "nothing published, this
    attempt" is the safe failure, and a raised traceback out of `chd-atlas
    validate` is not. `build_site`'s own call is untouched by this and still
    raises exactly as before.

    Returns an empty set, never `None`, when either validity mirror cannot be
    read or the computation above fails. `published_genes` has no optional
    form the way `known_genes` does — it must always be a `set[str]` — so an
    empty set is the fail-safe equivalent of the `None`-means-skip convention
    used elsewhere in this module: PRF009 only ever subtracts published genes
    *from* what a cell already has rows for, so an empty left-hand side can
    under-report a gap but can never invent a false one.

    **And the degradation cannot happen silently, which is what makes it
    acceptable without a skip code of its own.** Every way this returns empty
    is already an ERROR somewhere else in the same report, so the rule that a
    skip must arrive with the error that caused it holds structurally rather
    than by a paired warning. Measured 2026-08-15:

    - an unreadable mirror is TBL000, and `_mirrored_validity` pairs TBL012
      with it;
    - a dropped column is TBL001;
    - an unmapped classification term — the one case where the mirrors are
      readable *and* schema-valid — cannot reach `gene_validity` at all,
      because both `classification` columns carry `allowed=` sets that
      `tests/unit/test_vocab.py::test_every_mirrored_classification_maps_and_
      an_unknown_one_raises` pins equal to the vocab maps this function's
      callee dispatches on. Measured: 7/7 and 8/8 terms, no drift either way.

    **The catch is narrow for the same reason.** Only `KeyError` and
    `ValueError` are absorbed -- the two data failures above. A programmer
    error has no accompanying validation error to make it visible, so it must
    propagate rather than leave PRF009 silently dead in a green report.

    That last one is the load-bearing link and the only one that is not
    self-evident from this file. If that test is ever deleted, the two
    hand-written literals can drift, a term valid to the schema but unmapped
    by the vocab reaches `gene_validity`, this `except` swallows it, and
    PRF009 silently checks nothing in an otherwise green report.
