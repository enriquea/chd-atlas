    `mirrors/phospho/` carries no gene column at all, so the only route from a
    phospho row to a gene is `mirrors/genes.tsv:uniprot`, and that column is
    nullable. A gene whose cell is blank has its PTM sites published in a shard
    and summarised in no bundle: `"omics": {}` on the gene page while the browse
    row beside it advertises `evidence_counts: {"ptm": 1}` from the assertion.
    Reproduced end to end on a build reporting 0 errors and 0 warnings, which is
    what makes it this project's characteristic failure rather than a nuisance.

    Keyed on the curated side, not the mirror. Scanning the omics tables for
    unmatched accessions would report every protein the atlas has no gene for,
    which for a real proteomics release is most of them — the cascade REF000 and
    SRC000 exist to prevent. An assertion that *claims* PTM evidence is a small,
    curated set where every hit is actionable: the curator wrote the claim, so
    the missing cell is theirs to fill.

    Exact rather than heuristic. REF001 already guarantees the asserting gene is
    in the registry, so a null `uniprot` is the only remaining hole.

    A WARNING, not an error. The evidence is real and the assertion is sound; what
    is missing is one mirror cell, and refusing to build the site over it would be
    the wrong trade for a resource curated incrementally. `proteomics` is
    deliberately not covered — its rows carry their own nullable `gene` column, so
    an accession is one of two routes there rather than the only one.
