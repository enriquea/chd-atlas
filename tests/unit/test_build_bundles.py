    are merely unreachable from the gene index, so getting to them means already
    knowing the HGNC id. Its functional record is not published anywhere at all
    — no other build module reads `corpus.functional`, `derive.py` reads it only
    to count, and `build_genes` writes it only inside the loop over published
    genes. So the second half of this test is not about a missing link but about
    curated evidence that reaches no file: the record's id appears in none of
    the bytes the build wrote.

    Widening the gate to 23 genes did not close this. It moved which genes fall
    outside it — the cost now lands on a gene no panel has graded definitive
    rather than on one nobody has asserted — and D37 is the decision that keeps
    such candidate genes out of the definitive set rather than beside it.

    Pinned here so that either half changing is a decision rather than a side
    effect. The obvious one-line fix — keying the loop on the union of
    `published` and the functionally-evidenced genes — is what the index
    assertion below refuses; before this test existed, that mutation passed the
    whole suite.
