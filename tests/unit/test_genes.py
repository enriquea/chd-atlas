    (HGNC:4274) and the withdrawn name of OSR1 (HGNC:8111), and it is the only
    string in the committed registry that any two tiers both claim (measured
    2026-08-24: `approved & alias` and `approved & previous` are empty,
    `alias & previous` is exactly `{"ODD"}`). Merged into one index it is
    claimed twice and resolves to nothing; ranked, the live alias wins. HGNC
    retires a name into `prev_symbol` and leaves current synonyms in
    `alias_symbol`, so "still in use" beating "formerly official" is the

    retired name: `resolve` stops at the first tier that claims the name at all,
