"""The scope list is a selection among other people's claims, so it is shaped like one.

Every entry records which EXTERNAL authority treats the term as congenital heart
disease. That is not bookkeeping: "why is this gene here?" must have an answer,
and until 2026-08-06 the answer was a curator's name -- this file's own docstring
said inclusion "is the one thing about a gene the atlas asserts on its own
authority ... so it must have an answer with a name on it". It must have an
answer with an *authority* on it, and never an individual's: the atlas mirrors
every validity classification precisely because it cannot out-curate a chartered
expert panel, and deciding what counts as CHD is the same kind of judgement.

Adversarial review of #30 found this paragraph still asserting the old position
directly above a test named `..._and_names_no_individual`, in a file the change
had edited from line 12 down.
