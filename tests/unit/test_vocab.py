    The two must stay separable in both directions, and each assertion below

    - a supportive record beside a null result sets the new flag and **not**
      `has_conflicting_evidence` -- folding them together would give one
      laboratory's "we looked and found nothing" the weight of a chartered
      panel's refutation, which is what `CONTESTED` is for;
    - a genuinely contested gene sets `has_conflicting_evidence` and **not** the
      new flag, so the new one cannot be a second name for the old;
    - a null result *alone* sets neither. It disagrees with nothing, and a flag
      claiming otherwise would tell a reader two authorities differ where one
      spoke. Measured 2026-08-14: 9 in-scope genes are in exactly that position
      and none is published, so only a fixture can distinguish this.

    nothing beside it until this existed.

    A fallback would let a term an authority adds in a later release be silently
    coerced to something adjacent -- publishing a confidence nobody asserted.
    Refusing is the whole point: an unmapped term must reach a human.

    `Supportive` maps to None deliberately. It is GenCC's bucket for submitters
    that assert an association without grading evidence, so it has no rung on
    the ladder and must not be given one.

    Binds to the schemas' own `classification` column rather than importing
    `tables._CLINGEN_CLASSIFICATIONS` / `_GENCC_CLASSIFICATIONS` directly: those
    names are private to `tables.py`, and `Column.allowed` is already the
    schema's public way of exposing its vocabulary (see
    `test_tables.py::test_gencc_keys_on_the_submitter_because_it_publishes_no_verdict`,
    which reads the same column the same way). Going through that door instead
    of a private one keeps this test from opening its own back channel into
    another module -- and still fails exactly the same way if the two
    definitions drift: adding a term to one allowed set and not the other, or to
    a map and not the schema, still trips the set-equality assertions below.
