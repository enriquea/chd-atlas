# chd-atlas

A curated set of genes associated with CHD.

**Development status.** This atlas is under active development and is **not a
clinical decision-support tool** — it must not be used to make or guide a
diagnostic, treatment or any other clinical decision. Gene-disease validity is
mirrored from ClinGen and GenCC, never authored by this atlas itself, and the
evidence curated here so far is a small fraction of the genes that mirrored
validity data covers. The published site's front page (`index.html`) states
the exact, build-derived numbers behind that gap.

## Published data API

The atlas is served as static JSON built from the curated sources — no server,
no query language. Build it locally with:

```bash
uv run chd-atlas build --root . --out dist
```

The command refuses to write anything if `chd-atlas validate` would report an
error, so a published site always passed its own gate. Two builds of one commit
are byte-identical, and `manifest.json` carries a sha256 for every file it
lists — every served file except itself, which cannot contain its own checksum.

`sources.json` records what the atlas mirrors and on whose terms — phenotype
labels come from the Human Phenotype Ontology, whose licence requires
attribution; gene-disease validity is mirrored from ClinGen and GenCC, which
this atlas attributes but does not curate itself. The `LICENSE` in this
repository covers the code rather than mirrored third-party content.

The shape of each file is documented in [docs/data-api.md](docs/data-api.md).
Consumers should read that before writing against the output — in particular the
note on contested genes, which must never be displayed as settled.

## Validating the corpus

```bash
uv run chd-atlas validate
```

Reports every problem it finds rather than stopping at the first, and exits 1 on
any error, 2 if `--root` is not a directory.
